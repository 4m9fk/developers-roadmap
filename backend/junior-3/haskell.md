# Haskell for Junior-3

## Themes

* Basic type classes:
  * Monoids:
    * What is the purpose of `Semigroup` type class in contrast to `Monoid`?
    * Why does `Monoid` have `Semigroup` constraint?
    * What are the data declarations for `Dual`, `Endo`, `Sum`, `Product`, `Any`, `All`?  
      How and why theese monoids are used?
    * Why are there instances of `Monoid` for `(IO a)` and `(a -> b)`  
    and how they are used?

### Resources
